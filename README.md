# Python_predictionmoviegross
Python - Applying machine learning to predict the gross and movie trends

The project was developed via Python language using the list of packages as below:

- For scraping:
  * requests
  * csv
  * BeautifulSoup
  
- For building up models:
  * tkinter
  * pandas
  * numpy
  * seaborn
  * matplotlib
  * sklearn

Summary: Using history data of movies (genre, budget and gross) to predict the gross for a given genre and budget. In that:

- The scripts include two parts. The first part is to scrape the information from https://www.the-
numbers.com/movie/budgets/all and write them into a csv file. The second part is to develop a program building up a Linear Regression model based on the budget, gross and genre in that past. Following that, with a chosen genre, a model would base on the given budget to predict the gross and show the trend in future (up or down).

- Along with the scripts, a pdf file were provided for general information about this project and should be used as a guidelines.
